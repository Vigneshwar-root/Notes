Flutter:

flutter create . -> will create/repair the missing folders or files in flutter application 

flutter create new_app -> Use _ for the flutter project name and this command is used to create a new flutter app

flutter pub add google_fonts -> Command to install this package in flutter 

Note:  Click on Privacy & Security and after, click on for developers option. so that the dependencies will be reflected.



ctr + . -> VS code shortcut to get quick suggestions

Flutter Basics:


Flutter:

Material Design - 

	Google's Flexible design system
	
	A set of suggestions, rules and guidelines that help you build beautiful user interfaces
	Highly customizable and extendable 
	
	
	
	flutter config --android-studio-dir ""
	

flutter create . -> will create/repair the missing folders or files in flutter application 
	
	
Flutter Apps:
	main() function gets executed automatically 
			By dart, when executing the compiled app on the target device 
	
	runApp() should be called inside of main() 
			runApp() "tells" flutter what to display on the screen (i.e which UI elements to display)
			


	pass the to be displayed "widget-tree" to runApp()
			
			

	use const with the constructor to improve performance
		const helps Dart optimize run time performance


	Dart is a type safe language
	All values are of certain types 

	More than one type is possible and common

	'Hello World'		String Object 
	4		int num Object 
	MaterialApp		MaterialApp Widget Object 



Widgets are Objects -> and Objects are Data Structures in Memory 

Object - Core Key Concept in darts 

Classes - 
		Dart is an objects oriented language


Object is created by calling the "Constructor function" of a class 


------------------------------------

In Flutter Navigation works with Screen Stack 

Navigator.push(context, route) 

A stack of Screens 

Currently visible screen - The top most screen (in the stack of screens) is the one visible to the user. The other screen widgets (on lower layers) are not 
or partially visible 


Currently visible screen was Categories Screen 

Navigator.push() makes the currently visible screen as Meals Screen
