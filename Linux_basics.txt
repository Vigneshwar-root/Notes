Linux basics:

1. Kernel Version: To verify that the Linux kernel is installed correctly, use:  
uname -r

2. Distribution Information: To check which Linux distribution and version you are using:
lsb_release -a

3. List Installed Packages: To ensure that the package manager is working, you can list installed packages. For Debian-based distributions (like Ubuntu):
dpkg -l

4. List Running Services: To see if essential services are running, use:
systemctl list-units --type=service

5. Ping Test: To check if your network connection is working, try pinging an external server:
ping -c 4 google.com

6. Check IP Address: To see your network configuration:
ip a

7. Disk Space: To verify that your disk space is sufficient:
df -h

8. View System Logs: To check for any potential issues or errors:
journalctl -xe

9. List Hardware: To see information about your hardware:
lshw

You might need to install lshw if it's not already installed:

sudo dnf install lshw   # Fedora
